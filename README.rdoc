== The portuguese safe webmail client

http://www.ist.utl.pt/img/tecnico.png

This is a simple webmail client with support for sending/receiving signed, ciphered and compressed email.
Most of the logic of the email app is presented on the "aiss gem" which was also part of this project.

== Features:
* 128bit AES ECB body ciphered
* PKCS11 sign of the emails with the Portuguese Citizen card
* Will use IMAP to delete all your emails so use with caution
